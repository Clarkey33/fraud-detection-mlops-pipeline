# MLOps: End-to-End Fraud Detection System

> A production-style, local MLOps pipeline for training, validating, and deploying a credit card fraud detection model. This project serves as a comprehensive case study in building robust, reliable, and maintainable ML infrastructure.

---

## Project Goal (The "Why")

In the financial services industry, the speed and accuracy of fraud detection are paramount. However, building and deploying a machine learning model is only half the battle. A model that cannot be reliably retrained, validated, and redeployed is a liability, not an asset.

This project tackles this core business challenge by building a fully automated, production-style MLOps pipeline on a local machine. The final product is not just a model; it is a **system** that automatically trains, validates, and deploys a credit card fraud detection model, serving it via a containerized REST API. This is a case study in building the robust, reliable, and maintainable infrastructure that is essential for "Trustworthy AI" in a regulated environment.

## Key Principles & KPIs for a Production-Ready System

The entire architecture is designed around the following core principles, which serve as the project's key performance indicators.

*   **Reproducibility:** Can we reliably reproduce a model training run from any point in our Git history to ensure auditability and compliance?
*   **Automation:** How much of the process, from a new code commit to a deployed model, is fully automated to reduce manual error and increase speed?
*   **Modularity:** Is our code well-structured and easy to maintain, allowing for rapid, safe iteration by the team?
*   **Scalability:** While built locally, are the core principles we're using (e.g., Docker, CI/CD) directly scalable to a production cloud environment like AWS or Azure?

## MLOps Workflow

The project implements a complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) workflow for the machine learning model, orchestrated by GitHub Actions.
